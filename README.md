# Cruise Control

> an over-engineered caps lock notifier.

Cruise Control is a simple application that will notify you when you press the caps lock key.
There are plenty of other apps out there that will do the same thing but better. [Start here](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=caps+lock+notifier&t=h_&ia=web).

I had an urge to build something for macOS and try out a few concepts so this is not the most efficiently structured application. It scratched an itch I had and I learnt a few things along the way. Now it is here for anyone to do with as they please.

It has been updated to work with Big Sur.
